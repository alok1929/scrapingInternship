## How this works:

It works by using the <b>beautifulSoup<b> Library and a package called requests, all written in python. Then I have used the headers which basically acts as a get request to get the required data.

### I have created different functions to get different parts of webpage, such as title, rating, and review count

Next I have all the data stored in a into .csv which is under the name amazon_data.csv
